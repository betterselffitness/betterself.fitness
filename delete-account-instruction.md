# How to Delete Your Account and Data

At BetterSelf.fitness, we value your privacy and give you full control over your
data. We provide two separate options for managing your data: resetting all data
stored on your device, and permanently deleting your account from our servers.

## Reset All Data

This option clears all data stored on your device and resets preferences to
default values, but **does not delete your account** from our servers. You can
continue using the app with your existing account after resetting.

### How to Reset All Data via the App

**Important Note:** All your health tracking data, exercise plans, and
preferences are stored locally on your phone device. We do not store this data
on our servers. Resetting will only clear data from your device.

1. Open the **BetterSelf.fitness** app on your device.
2. Navigate to the **User Account** menu.
3. Locate the **Reset All Data** section.
4. Select **Reset All Data**.
5. You will be asked to confirm your decision. Please note that this action is
   **irreversible**. Once confirmed, the following will be permanently removed
   from your device:
   - All health tracking data (sleep, fasting, exercise, calories, water,
     weight)
   - All exercise plans and entries
   - All user preferences and settings
   - All daily logs and notes

### What Happens After Reset

- Your device data is cleared and preferences reset to defaults
- The app will restart to reinitialize with fresh data

**irreversible** and cannot be undone.

our servers:
